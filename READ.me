        <p style="color:white">The development of the CYOA was different as it took into perspective both programming and story telling. This was somewhat taxing as I tried
        to keep the story in line as well as all the different paths that the reader could choose. This CYOA is not complete and may sound like it ends abruptly but future development
        can be made.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-5 px-1" width="100%">
                    <div class="imageContainer">
                        <img src="Images/StoryCode.png" alt="Story Code" class="border img-fluid" width="100%">
                    </div>
                    <p style="color:white">The Story Code</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-5 px-1">
                    <img src="Images/ResultOutput.png" alt="Results" class="border img-fluid" width="100%">

        <p style="color:white">This story is designed to take drastic turns. So don't be surprised when your choice is not what you expected.</p>
        <h3>How to Rad:</h3>
        <p style="color:white">The story is a word choice path. You will be required to enter in your choice and there is error checking that will prevent all input. Character caser is ignored and will not cause issues but make sure you type your choice the same way as it is requested.</p>
        
        <h3>Struggles:</h3>
        <p style="color:white">The biggest struggle with this code was keeping the story in line as well as the code. Writing the code was not difficult but making sure that each narative was attached to the story line that it belonged came with some difficulty and a lot of testing.</p>
