You wake up with a pounding headache barely able to open your eyes. 
You reach over and put on your glasses to go grab a drink of water. Sitting up, you notice something is off. 
There are three doors where the night before there was only one. At least that's what you remember. Slowly gettng up 
you make your way towards the newly discovered doors. None of them look like your door and all of them look out of place. 
Do you aproach the doors or do you go back to bed as this is all a bad dream?

Bed

You decide to go back to bed and hope this is all a bad dream. You lay down and close your eyes. 
You feel yourself falling asleep and then you wake up again. You wake up back in your room with nothing unusual. 
You walk around looking at everything before noticing the footprints on your floor. They end at the wall. 
Do you examine the footprints or ignore them?
